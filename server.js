    summary:
      "Sumatran orangutans are Critically Endangered, with only around 14,600 left in the wild. The greatest threat to their survival is the loss of their rain forest home – forest destruction for farmlands in Sumatra is happening on a massive scale. As a result, orangutans often become stranded in patches of forest surrounded by plantations. They are at risk of starvation, hunting and poaching. We rescue orangutans and work with farmers to help them protect their crops without harming wildlife.",
    challenge:
      "When orangutans get stranded in farmlands, they may raid the crops to find enough food to survive. This is bad news for both sides. For the farmers, raided or damaged crops can have a real impact on income. But for orangutans, the outcome can be catastrophic. They risk starvation and are exposed to higher levels of hunting and poaching. As a critically endangered species, these are risks the Sumatran orangutan could well do without.",
    solution:
      "The Orangutan Information Centre (OIC), our partners in Sumatra, work with farmers and plantation workers, providing training in various methods of Human-Orangutan Conflict prevention such as using noise to scare the orangutans off. The team is also regularly involved in rescuing orangutans being illegally kept as pets, or relocating orangutans found stranded in farmlands back into the forest.",
    impact:
      "As well as rescuing orangutans in danger we support the government in their law enforcement efforts for wildlife and ecosystem conservation. Government officials always accompany our team on each rescue or confiscation mission for illegally held captive orangutans, so there is close collaboration and capacity building actively in place. Our hope and intention is that we will be able to support government and communities alike to reduce encroachment of farmlands and protect the remaining forests.",

      "At Phnom Tamao Wildlife Rescue Center animals rescued from Cambodia’s illegal wildlife trade get the care they need to recover. Most are released into protected habitat after rehabilitation. Animals unsuitable for release are provided a permanent home. Captive-breeding programs for rare species enable animals to naturally bond and mate. New generations are released to bolster wild populations or to reintroduce species at sites where they were wiped out, such as the Angkor Temple Complex.",
    challenge:
      "Animals rescued from Cambodia’s illegal wildlife trade that have suffered injuries need specialized care to survive and recover – and some require expensive, lifelong care. Phnom Tamao is home to more than 1,200 rescued animals from over 100 species. Every month, newly rescued animals arrive and rehabilitated wildlife is released. No animal in need is ever turned away, including those such as Chhouk, an elephant who lost his foot to a snare as a calf and now walks with a prosthetic shoe.",
    solution:
      "This project increases survival rates for rescued animals through proper medical attention and quality care. Under the care of the Centre’s dedicated veterinarians and keepers, animals thrive on natural diets in large enclosures within a 6,000 acre forest. Suitable animals are released in protected areas. Individuals that require lifelong care are given a permanent home. Captive-breeding programs for threatened species ensure their offspring can be reintroduced to found new wild populations.",
    impact:
      "Your donations ensure rescued Cambodian wildlife is properly rehabilitated and either provided permanent sanctuary or released into well-protected habitat. Without the Centre, these animals would not survive. Released animals support the long-term recovery of wild populations. The Centre is visited by ~300,000 Cambodian visitors annually, fostering appreciation for their native fauna and demonstrating how wildlife should be treated humanely, in contrast with the cruelty of local zoos.",

      "Each year, 3.5 million experience homelessness in America according to the National Coalition for the Homeless. We estimate that 10-25% of homeless have pets, many are service animals The need for veterinary care is at an all-time high when a pet is injured or ill.",
    solution:
      "Our organization is important to the homeless people that need veterinary care for their companion pets. It is about the people who need help for their ill or injured pets. In some cases, the homeless survive with the daily responsibility of pet guardianship. There is scientific evidence that shows animals are good for us. From depression and post-traumatic stress disorder to heart health and autism, the human-animal bond has a powerful, measurable impact on people’s lives.",

      "Everyday we receive calls to end the pain and suffering of pets that belong to the homeless. One pet at a time- we strive to reunite healthy, pain free pets back to their homeless guardians. In doing so we are also keeping communities safe from diseases. We are keeping the bond of animal/human love alive with your donation.",
